##  Kimai Time Tracking Tool

Kimai is a time-tracking app with a long history. Its first version was released 2006. Why do we mention that? Because we have seen so many services come and go in the last decade - trust us when we say: we’ll stick around. We never made a living from Kimai, it’s the fun that keeps us motivated to improve Kimai. We believe that’s one of the main reasons for Kimai’s success.
